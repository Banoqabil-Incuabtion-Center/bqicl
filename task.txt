🛠 Project Tech StackBackend:
 Node.js with Express.js.Database:
  MySQL/MariaDB using Sequelize ORM.
  Real-Time Engine: Socket.io (WebSocket) for bi-directional, event-driven communication.
  Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine and Tailwind CSS for styling.
  Security: CSRF protection, session management with express-session, and cookie-parser.

🏗 System Architecture & Workflow
The system utilizes a State-Driven 3-Screen Architecture.
All clients are synchronized via a central Node.js server.

Screen,Route,Primary Objective
Admin  /admin/auction    Session control, player queue management, and final sales.
Owner /owner/auction      Real-time bidding interface with budget tracking.
Audience  /audience/auction   Cinematic projector view for public display of live bids.



2. The Operational Lifecycle
Global Initialization: Admin triggers session_initialized. This toggles global.auctionActive, sends a Socket.io broadcast to all owners, and enables the "Join Auction" UI.

The Call to Block: Admin selects a player. The server updates the Auction model (ID: 1) and emits the player's metadata (image, name, base price) to all rooms.

Live Bidding: Owners emit place_bid. The server validates the bid against the team's remainingBudget and the current Auction.currentBid. If valid, it updates the DB and broadcasts a bid_update.

Finalization: Admin closes bidding. On "Sold," the server updates the Player model (links teamId), decrements the team's remainingBudget, and resets the Auction state for the next player.


🧠 Database Logic & Schemas
The database is structured to maintain integrity even if a user refreshes their browser.

Player Model: Tracks individual stats, basePrice, soldPrice, and auction status (available, bidding, sold, unsold).

Team Model: Manages financial limits with totalBudget and remainingBudget (Data Type: BIGINT to prevent overflow).

Auction Model: Stores the "Active State" of the current bid. Includes playerId, currentBid, and lastBidTeamId.

BidHistory Model: An immutable log of every bid placed for audit trails and UI logs.
